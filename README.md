## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

-> While working through this project I got the real understanding that how a html elements form a foundation for the beautful webpages.

-> Then I would like to say how CSS beautifies the effect. Especially the media queries part that would add another beauty just by adding the reponsiveness.

### Continued development
I would like to continue on the development of my html and CSS skills and looking forward to work with  javacript for future projects as well.

### Useful resources
